This owner lease is then verified inside every\r\n * transaction to ensure the lease has not been lost.\r\n *\r\n * If a tab opts not to acquire the owner lease (because there's an existing\r\n * non-expired owner) or loses the owner lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a\r\n * failed state and all subsequent operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * The current owner regularly refreshes the owner lease with new timestamps to\r\n * prevent newly-opened tabs from taking over ownership.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the owner\r\n * lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make sure that\r\n * a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the owner lease).\r\n * Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload since it is\r\n * an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the lease,\r\n * the owner writes its ownerId to a \"zombiedOwnerId\" entry in LocalStorage\r\n * which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and take the\r\n * owner lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n */\r\nvar IndexedDbPersistence = /** @class */ /*@__PURE__*/ (function () {\r\n    function IndexedDbPersistence(prefix, serializer) {\r\n        this.ownerId = this.generateOwnerId();\r\n        this.dbName = prefix + IndexedDbPersistence.MAIN_DATABASE;\r\n        this.serializer = new LocalSerializer(serializer);\r\n        this.localStoragePrefix = prefix;\r\n    }\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.start = function () {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        if (!IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable()) {\r\n            this.persistenceError = new FirestoreError(Code.UNIMPLEMENTED, UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_ERROR_MSG);\r\n            return Promise.reject(this.persistenceError);\r\n        }\r\n        assert(!this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence double-started!');\r\n        this.started = true;\r\n        return SimpleDb.openOrCreate(this.dbName, SCHEMA_VERSION, createOrUpgradeDb)\r\n            .then(function (db) {\r\n            _this.simpleDb = db;\r\n        })\r\n            .then(function () { return _this.tryAcquireOwnerLease(); })\r\n            .then(function () {\r\n            _this.scheduleOwnerLeaseRefreshes();\r\n            _this.attachWindowUnloadHook();\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.shutdown = function (deleteData) {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        assert(this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence shutdown without start!');\r\n        this.started = false;\r\n        this.detachWindowUnloadHook();\r\n        this.stopOwnerLeaseRefreshes();\r\n        return this.releaseOwnerLease().then(function () {\r\n            _this.simpleDb.close();\r\n            if (deleteData) {\r\n                return SimpleDb.delete(_this.dbName);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getMutationQueue = function (user) {\r\n        return IndexedDbMutationQueue.forUser(user, this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getQueryCache = function () {\r\n        return new IndexedDbQueryCache(this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getRemoteDocumentCache = function () {\r\n        return new IndexedDbRemoteDocumentCache(this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.runTransaction = function (action, operation) {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        if (this.persistenceError) {\r\n            return Promise.reject(this.persistenceError);\r\n        }\r\n        debug(LOG_TAG$3, 'Starting transaction:', action);\r\n        // Do all transactions as readwrite against all object stores, since we\r\n        // are the only reader/writer.\r\n        return this.simpleDb.runTransaction('readwrite', ALL_STORES, function (txn) {\r\n            // Verify that we still have the owner lease as part of every transaction.\r\n            return _this.ensureOwnerLease(txn).next(function () { return operation(txn); });\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable = function () {\r\n        return SimpleDb.isAvailable();\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\r\n     * LocalStorage.\r\n     */\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.buildStoragePrefix = function (databaseInfo) {\r\n        // Use two different prefix formats:\r\n        //\r\n        //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\r\n        //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\r\n        //\r\n        // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\r\n        // so there's no danger of collisions.\r\n        var database = databaseInfo.databaseId.projectId;\r\n        if (!databaseInfo.databaseId.isDefaultDatabase) {\r\n            database += '.' + databaseInfo.databaseId.database;\r\n        }\r\n        return 'firestore/' + databaseInfo.persistenceKey + '/' + database + '/';\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Acquires the owner lease if there's no valid owner.

So you will also\\nneed to update code expecting a Date to instead expect a Timestamp. For example:\\n\\n  // Old:\\n  const date = snapshot.get('created_at');\\n  // New:\\n  const timestamp = snapshot.get('created_at');\\n  const date = timestamp.toDate();\\n\\nPlease audit all existing usages of Date when you enable the new behavior. In a\\nfuture release, the behavior will change to the new behavior, so if you do not\\nfollow these steps, YOUR APP MAY BREAK.\");\r\n        }\r\n        assert(!this._firestoreClient, 'configureClient() called multiple times');\r\n        var databaseInfo = new DatabaseInfo(this._config.databaseId, this._config.persistenceKey, this._config.settings.host, this._config.settings.ssl);\r\n        var preConverter = function (value) {\r\n            if (value instanceof DocumentReference) {\r\n                var thisDb = _this._config.databaseId;\r\n                var otherDb = value.firestore._config.databaseId;\r\n                if (!otherDb.isEqual(thisDb)) {\r\n                    throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, 'Document reference is for database ' +\r\n                        (otherDb.projectId + \"/\" + otherDb.database + \" but should be \") +\r\n                        (\"for database \" + thisDb.projectId + \"/\" + thisDb.database));\r\n                }\r\n                return new DocumentKeyReference(_this._config.databaseId, value._key);\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                return value;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        this._dataConverter = new UserDataConverter(preConverter);\r\n        this._firestoreClient = new FirestoreClient(PlatformSupport.getPlatform(), databaseInfo, this._config.credentials, this._queue);\r\n        return this._firestoreClient.start(persistence);\r\n    };\r\n    Firestore.databaseIdFromApp = function (app) {\r\n        var options = app.options;\r\n        if (!contains(options, 'projectId')) {\r\n            // TODO(b/62673263): We can safely remove the special handling of\r\n            // 'firestoreId' once alpha testers have upgraded.\r\n            if (contains(options, 'firestoreId')) {\r\n                throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, '\"firestoreId\" is now specified as \"projectId\" in ' +\r\n                    'firebase.initializeApp.');\r\n            }\r\n            throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, '\"projectId\" not provided in firebase.initializeApp.');\r\n        }\r\n        if (contains(options, 'firestoreOptions')) {\r\n            // TODO(b/62673263): We can safely remove the special handling of\r\n            // 'firestoreOptions' once alpha testers have upgraded.\r\n            throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, '\"firestoreOptions\" values are now specified with ' +\r\n                'Firestore.settings()');\r\n        }\r\n        var projectId = options['projectId'];\r\n        if (!projectId || typeof projectId !== 'string') {\r\n            throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, 'projectId must be a string in FirebaseApp.options');\r\n        }\r\n        return new DatabaseId(projectId);\r\n    };\r\n    Object.defineProperty(Firestore.prototype, \"app\", {\r\n        get: function () {\r\n            if (!this._config.firebaseApp) {\r\n                throw new FirestoreError(Code.FAILED_PRECONDITION, \"Firestore was not initialized using the Firebase SDK.
